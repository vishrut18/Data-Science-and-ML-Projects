This repository contains files of various projects involving Data Analysis and Machine Learning Algorithms.

## 1. LendingClub Loan_Status Predictive model using Decision Tress and Random Forests

I have used LendingClub Dataset obtained from Kaggle. Given historical data on loans given out with information on whether or not the borrower defaulted (charge-off), after initial EDA and Feature engineering, I have built a model that can predict whether or not a borrower will pay back their loan? This way in the future when the company gets a new potential customer they can assess if they are likely to pay back the loan. 

## 2. Breast Cancer classification model using Support Vector Machine algorithm

Using the built in breast cancer dataset from Scikit Learn, I have built a model using Support Vector Machines (SVM) algorithm to classify the cancer as Malignant or Benign from the features available.

## 3. Analyzing 911 Calls for Montgomery County, PA

Using the dataset from Kaggle.com, I analyzed 911 Calls for Montomery County, PA. Analysis involved finding the main reason for majority of calls and what was the most busy hour in the day, day of the week and month.

## 4.4a. Geographical Visualization Using Plotly

This is not a project per se, but I just wanted to explore geographical visualizations using Plotly and Cufflinks.
I have used two data sets: 1) World Power Consumption - 2014 and 2) USA Election - 2012.
Refer to the two png. files uploaded to see the visualization.


## 5. Decline Curve Analysis and Production Forecasting
